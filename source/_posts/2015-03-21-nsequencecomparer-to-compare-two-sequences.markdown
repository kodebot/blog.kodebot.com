<p>I had a requirement&nbsp;to compare two sequences to find the differences in .NET platform. To compare large sequences, I needed an algorithm that&nbsp;does not use recursion.&nbsp;I could not find anything in <!-- more -->the internet that I can use out of the box, so, I created&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NSequenceComparer/" target="_blank">this nuget package</a></p>
<p>This package is very simple to use, you can read usage instructions&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/vmanikandan001/NSequenceComparer/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Feel free to use and contribute.</p>
